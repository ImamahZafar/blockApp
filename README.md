# blockApp
Worked on a Screen time app during my fifth semester in the course Software for Mobile Devices.<br />
The app allows users to manage their screen time by monitoring the apps used and the duration of usage.<br />
It also provides feature of blocking or hibernating applications installed on the user’s mobile. <br />
Screen time functionality, MVC , Google’s Firebase authentication and java concepts were used. <br />
It has the following features:<br />
  *Hibernate App: User can use the app for a predefined time. When the time limit is reached, app is blocked<br />
  *Block App:
    User can block an app for undefined time
